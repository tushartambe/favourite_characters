      <label>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</label> Captain Jack Sparrow is a
      fictional character in the Pirates of the Caribbean film series. The
      character was performed by Johnny Depp. He is one of the most original,
      inventive, unexpected, unpredictable and delightful characters in movie
      history, and that is attributable to Johnny's determination not to take
      the roads most traveled. He's entirely self-serving, but can surprisingly
      come through heroically in a pinch. He pretends not to care about anyone
      or anything except himself, but when push comes to shove, Captain Jack
      does have a heart after all. And most of all, he loves and cherishes his
      freedom, sailing the seas on his greatest love of all, the Black Pearl.
